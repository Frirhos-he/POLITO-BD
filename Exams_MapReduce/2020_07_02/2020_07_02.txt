1. Since the files size I would consider dividing the former by the size of HDFS block.
Since file n.1 --> 1 + 1
Since file n.2 --> 1 + 1
The result is 4. I would not consider a mapper doing a merge of the 2 files.
Hadoop split the file in blocks. So the total number of blocks is 4.

2. The program prints 2, 1 and 2
A final value can be assigned only once.
